[B5] EMAIL LIST APP

PURPOSE: A small application that will effectively run like a Mailchimp subscription application.  It will:
  - save new users to our database
  - allow us to see, edit and delete the saved users
  - allow us to email the users (only if hosted on a web host using their email services!)

SETUP STEPS [OPTIONAL]:
H. OPTIONAL - Setup new Email Users Page, to allow us to email a user using WebHost services [NOT FUNCTIONAL UNLESS HOSTED ON WEB HOST SERVER!]
  (1) Include the header, navbar, connection & footer into our new page (just COPY from index.php up to connection include!)

  (2) Open & Load Emails into Variable
    - Store SQL & result from DB in variable
    - NOTE: WHILE LOOP & Output data of each row like with manageUsers.php, but appends it into a list separated by commas
    - EXAMPLE "Users: Fitzy@gmail.com, Bicky@gmail.com, johnnyd@gmail.com, joey@gmail.com"

  (3) Setup Basic Structure of Email Form 

  (4) Structure the Email by Passing in Emails Variable + Form Data + Web Host Header Information
    - Declare Variables for Emails, Form Data & Headers
    - CHECK & UPDATE HEADER INFo: These change to the web host specific details
    - SEND: Email with Mail function

  (5) Refactor Code into Good Server-side Architecture 
    - Create a "templates" folder for repeated HTML elemenets
    - Create an "includes" folder for server-side logic
